## 5.0 System Design

### 5.1 Architecture Diagram

The OLMS employs a **three-tier architecture**:

*   **Presentation Layer (Frontend)**: Built with React.js, responsible for the user interface and user interaction. It communicates with the backend via RESTful API calls.
*   **Application Layer (Backend)**: Developed using Python (Flask), responsible for business logic, data processing, AI functionalities (recommendations, quiz generation), and handling API requests from the frontend.
*   **Data Layer (Database)**: A relational database (likely SQLite, defined by `schema.sql`) storing all application data, including user information, course details, enrollments, progress, feedback, and messages.

```
+-----------------+       +-----------------+       +-----------------+
|     Frontend    |       |     Backend     |       |    Database     |
|   (React.js)    | <---> |    (Python/     | <---> |    (SQL/        |
|                 |       |     Flask)      |       |    SQLite)      |
+-----------------+       +-----------------+       +-----------------+
      User Interface        Business Logic           Data Storage
      User Interaction      API Endpoints            Schema.sql
      Component-based       AI Services              database.py
```

### 5.2 ER Diagram

(This section would present an Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram, visually representing the entities (tables) in the database and the relationships between them. Key entities would include:
*   **Users**: (Students, Instructors, Admins)
*   **Courses**
*   **Modules**
*   **Enrollments** (linking Users and Courses)
*   **Quizzes**
*   **Questions**
*   **Answers**
*   **Progress** (tracking user completion of modules/quizzes)
*   **Feedback**
*   **Messages**
The diagram would show primary keys, foreign keys, and cardinality of relationships.)

### 5.3 UML Diagrams

(This section would include various Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams to illustrate the system's design and behavior:
*   **Use Case Diagrams**: To show the interactions between users (actors) and the system, defining the system's boundaries and primary functionalities.
*   **Class Diagrams**: To illustrate the static structure of the system, showing classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships.
*   **Sequence Diagrams**: To depict the interactions between objects in a time-ordered sequence, showing how operations are carried out.
*   **Activity Diagrams**: To model the flow of control from activity to activity, representing the workflow of a system.
*   **Component Diagrams**: To show the structural relationships between components of the software system.)

### 5.4 Wireframe Diagram

(This section would present wireframe diagrams, which are low-fidelity visual representations of the user interface. They would illustrate the layout and arrangement of content on key screens (e.g., Login, Dashboard, Course Details, Quiz Page) without focusing on visual design elements. Their purpose is to define the structure and functionality of the user interface early in the design process.)

## 6.0 Implementation

### 6.1 Technology Stack

The OLMS project is implemented using a modern and robust technology stack:

*   **Backend**:
    *   **Language**: Python
    *   **Framework**: Flask (a lightweight web framework)
    *   **Database Interaction**: `database.py` module, likely using a database connector for SQLite.
    *   **AI/ML**: Python libraries for AI recommendations (`ai_recommendations.py`) and quiz generation (`quiz_generator.py`), potentially leveraging Google Generative AI or similar.
    *   **Dependencies**: Managed via `requirements.txt`.
*   **Frontend**:
    *   **Library**: React.js
    *   **Language**: JavaScript (with JSX)
    *   **Styling**: CSS modules (e.g., `App.css`, component-specific `.css` files).
    *   **Package Management**: npm/Yarn (via `package.json`, `package-lock.json`).
*   **Database**:
    *   **Type**: Relational Database (likely SQLite for development/simplicity).
    *   **Schema Definition**: SQL (`schema.sql`).

### 6.2 Design patterns

While a detailed code review would be needed to identify specific design patterns, the project's structure suggests adherence to common architectural and design principles:

*   **Layered Architecture**: The clear separation into Frontend, Backend, and Database layers is a fundamental architectural pattern.
*   **Component-Based Architecture (Frontend)**: React promotes a component-based approach, where the UI is broken down into reusable, independent components (e.g., `Login.js`, `Courses.js`, `Chatbot.js`).
*   **MVC/MVT (Backend Conceptual)**: Although Flask is flexible, the separation of `app.py` (controller/view logic), `database.py` (model/data access), and potentially separate business logic modules (like `ai_recommendations.py`) aligns conceptually with Model-View-Controller (MVC) or Model-View-Template (MVT) patterns.
*   **Repository Pattern (Data Access)**: The `database.py` module acts as a repository, abstracting data access logic from the main application logic.

### 6.3 Implementation of the program

The implementation involves the development of distinct but interconnected components:

*   **Backend Development**:
    *   **API Endpoints**: `backend/app.py` defines RESTful API endpoints for all functionalities (e.g., user authentication, course retrieval, feedback submission, AI requests).
    *   **Database Interaction**: `backend/database.py` handles all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with the SQLite database based on the `schema.sql`.
    *   **Business Logic**: Modules like `ai_recommendations.py` and `quiz_generator.py` implement the core business and AI logic, processing data and generating intelligent responses.
    *   **Configuration**: `backend/config.py` manages application settings, and `.env` handles environment-specific variables.
*   **Frontend Development**:
    *   **Component Creation**: Each UI element and page is built as a reusable React component (e.g., `Login.js`, `StudentDashboard.js`, `Courses.js`).
    *   **State Management**: Components manage their local state using React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
    *   **API Integration**: Components make asynchronous HTTP requests to the backend API endpoints to fetch and send data.
    *   **Routing**: `frontend/src/App.js` handles client-side routing, rendering different components based on the URL.
    *   **Styling**: `App.css`, `index.css`, and component-specific `.css` files provide the visual design.
*   **Database Setup**:
    *   `database/schema.sql` defines the database structure.
    *   Scripts like `create_database.py` and `add_sample_*.py` are used to initialize and populate the database for development and testing.

## 7.0 Testing and Validation

### Test Plan

The testing strategy for the OLMS project would involve a combination of:
*   **Unit Testing**: Testing individual functions, methods, and components in isolation to ensure they work as expected.
*   **Integration Testing**: Testing the interactions between different modules and components (e.g., frontend-backend communication, backend-database interaction).
*   **System Testing**: Testing the complete integrated system to verify that it meets all specified requirements.
*   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Involving end-users (students, instructors, administrators) to validate the system's usability and functionality in a real-world scenario.

### Test Cases

The project includes dedicated test files, indicating a commitment to testing:
*   **`test_ai_system.py`**: Tests for the AI recommendation system.
*   **`test_backend.py`**: General tests for backend functionalities.
*   **`test_feedback.py`**: Tests for the feedback submission and retrieval.
*   **`test_instructor_feedback.py`**: Tests for instructor-related feedback.
